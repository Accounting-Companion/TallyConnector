**TallyConnector** is a C# library that serves as a bridge to the Tally XML API.

With **TallyConnector**, you can say goodbye to the complexities of creating and parsing XMLs. Instead, you interact directly with C# objects, making your coding experience smoother and more efficient.

Experience the power of abstraction and let **TallyConnector** handle the heavy lifting of XML manipulation for you!

# v3 Changelog

## What's New in v3.0

### 🚀 Auto TDL Report Generation
We've introduced an automatic TDL report generation feature using source generators. 
- You no longer have to manually create TDL reports.
- Our source generator creates TDL definitions automatically based on your C# models.

### ⚡ Performance Improvements
- **Fetch Only Required Fields**: To optimize performance and efficiency, we've added a feature that fetches only the data you need from Tally. This significantly reduces data transfer size and speeds up operations.
